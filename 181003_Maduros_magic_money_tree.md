Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro's "magic" reform of new currency, increasing price of fuel and rise in minimum wage will not work.

Venezuela's economy is in a disasterous state with falling to one-third from 2013 to 2017. Despite the largest oil reserve, Venezuela can't import food and meidcine, there is water shortages, and blackouts, resulting more than 2m people fleeing the country.

Mr.Maduro's blaming this to Big power, but real reasons are crackpot socialism, expropriations, price controls undermining private firms, depressing production. Also mismanagement of state-owned oil company, PDVSA, caused oil production drop.

While realizing these problems and coming up with new policies to resolve issues, it is unlikely that would happen.
New currency has way too low confidence with nothing bound to it, claim for resolving budget deficit will be undermined by tax break for the oil industry and increasing minimum wage, leading to public-sector wage bill, more inflation, and more bankrupt firms.

Aside from having someone else as Venezuelan president, the country desperately needs helps from international community.
