Being nice has always been my life. 
However, as I grow older, I keep on getting other opinions on this matter. 
Where I stand currently right now is hard to tell, since changing your personality is the hardest thing to do, or something you should not be doing in the first place at all.

Linux Torvalds, as far as I can tell and as he claims, is not a nice person.
At least when it comes to dealing with technology, probably not as a person.

I guess the biggest question is. What is wrong with 'being not nice'?
What are disadvantages of it?

Monk Bubyoon said that when you feeling somebody is taking advantage of you because you were being nice, and if you are trying to become otherwise, you are forgetting all positive side of being nice.
This is true. Everything has two sides to it.

But this doesn't mean you need those positive side of being nice. If you decide that you can let go of them a bit and compormise them by becoming less nice, and if you feel okay about it. I don't see any problem for it.

At the end of the day, the important thing is that you are true to your self and not pretending to be something you are not. In short, be honest to who you are.

Am I pretending to be a nice person? Am I making an unncessary effort to become one?

In this sense, whatever views on subjects aside, at least I feel like Linux Torvalds is honest with himself.
And he seems to be content with it as well for being not the cuddly person.
